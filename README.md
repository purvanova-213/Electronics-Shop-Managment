This is a simple core Java+ Sql application made using Jswings library in java. It uses Mysql workbench as DB.

The images used are included in imagesused folder. To make the render after downloading the project you need to change the image address depending on location in your computer.

To connect to DB use JDBC connector.

// create connection conn Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"); conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/store", "aaa", "bbb"); // here aaa is Db login username whereas bbb is password and store is Database name where table is present.
